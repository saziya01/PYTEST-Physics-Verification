##  Theoretical Foundations: Exploring Physics Through Computation

Physics is the language of the universe, describing everything from the motion of planets to the behavior of atoms. Yet, many physical systems are inherently complex, nonlinear, and influenced by randomness—making traditional pen-and-paper solutions impossible. That’s where **computational physics** steps in, harnessing the power of computers to simulate, analyze, and predict the behavior of these intricate systems.

This repository is a playground for such explorations, featuring a diverse collection of physics models implemented in Python, each paired with rigorous **pytest** tests to guarantee scientific accuracy and code reliability.

###  Nonlinear Dynamics & Oscillators

Nature loves complexity. Models like **coupled oscillators** and the **Brusselator** reveal how simple mathematical rules can lead to fascinating phenomena: oscillations, synchronization, bifurcations, and even chaos.

These systems provide deep insights into real-world processes like:
- Heart rhythms  
- Chemical reactions  
- Climate dynamics

###  Embracing Randomness: Stochastic Models

Not all systems are deterministic. Random fluctuations are inherent in many natural processes, from molecular collisions to ecological interactions.

Models included:
- **Stochastic Brusselator**
- **Stochastic Lotka-Volterra**

These simulate how randomness affects time evolution, leading to more realistic and variable system behaviors.

###  Statistical Mechanics & Phase Transitions

The **Ising model** is a cornerstone of statistical physics. It demonstrates how simple local rules (spins interacting with neighbors) lead to large-scale order or disorder.

Through simulation, we can:
- Observe phase transitions
- Study magnetization
- Understand critical phenomena

###  Classical Physics: Timeless Principles in Motion

Not everything is complex! This project also revisits classical problems, such as:
- **Projectile motion**
- **Radioactive decay**

These simulations reinforce fundamental laws using modern computational methods.

##  Scientific Integrity: Automated Testing with Pytest

Every model is paired with a test module using **pytest**, which:
- Validates results against analytical or benchmark solutions
- Ensures numerical stability across edge cases
- Detects regressions during future development

This makes the code **reliable**, **reproducible**, and **scientifically trustworthy**.
